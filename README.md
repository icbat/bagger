### Installing dependencies

1. Install NPM by installing NodeJS
2. Install NPM  development dependencies: `npm install`
3. Install all dependencies needed to build with: `bower install`
4. Use Gulp to move the specific distributables into the www directory using `gulp copy-bower`
5. Get Cordova working and add the platform you care about working on (Contribution wanted for better instructions for this!)
